# TopoGenie

TopoGenie is a minimal scaffold for an MCTS-driven analog topology generator.

## Project Structure

```
topogenie/
    __init__.py
    euler_mcts.py
    netlist_io.py
    vocab_and_adjacency.py
scripts/
    run.py
```

The `topogenie` directory holds the core library modules (currently
placeholders).  Scripts or experiments can live in the `scripts` directory.

## Getting Started

1. Add implementation code to the modules in `topogenie/`.
2. Use `scripts/run.py` as an entry point for running experiments or
   training routines.
